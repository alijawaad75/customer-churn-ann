# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction with ANN

This project uses a neural network (ANN) to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

## 📌 What I Did:
- Loaded & cleaned real-world housing data
- Scaled features using StandardScaler
- Built a 3-layer ANN using Keras
- Trained over 100 epochs and tracked loss/MAE
- Evaluated the model on test data
- Visualized training vs validation metrics

## 📊 Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Results:
- Final Test MSE: `0.4054`
- Final MAE: `0.3601`

## 📷 Sample Plots:

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to preprocess data for ANN models
- Feature scaling and train/test split
- Neural network design and tuning
